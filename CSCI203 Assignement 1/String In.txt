
This is a simple finite State Machine to handle input from a file and break it into words



word: array [1..100] of char				// words will not be longer than 100 characters each
int len=0						// the length of the current word
bool inword=false					// keep track of the state - in a word or not
input: char

do 
	get a character from the file into input
	if input is a space 				//" ", tab, nl, isspace(char)
		if inword				// this space is at the end of a word
			process the current word	
			len=0
	else if input is a letter 			// we are starting or continuing a word
		inword = true
		word[++len] = lowercase(input)		// store the letter at the end of the (possibly empty) word
while not eof
if len > 0 process the last word 			// we may have a word if the file ended after an alpha character.
